<p><em>“Quasi-Triangularizations of Matrix Polynomials over Arbitrary Fields”</em></p>
<p>In their 2013 paper in <em>Linear Algebra and Its Applications</em>, Taslaman, Tisseur, and Zaballa show that any regular matrix polynomial <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\lambda)\)</span> over an
algebraically closed field is unimodularly equivalent to a triangular matrix polynomial of the same degree.
When <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\lambda)\)</span> is real,they also show that there is a real quasi-triangular matrix polynomial of the
same degree that is unimodularly equivalent to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\lambda)\)</span>, in which the diagonal blocks are of size
at most <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2 \times 2\)</span>. This paper generalizes these results to regular matrix polynomials
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\lambda)\)</span> over arbitrary fields <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{F}\)</span>, showing that any such <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\lambda)\)</span> can be
quasitriangularized to a matrix polynomial over F of the same degree, in which the largest diagonal block
size is bounded by the highest degree appearing among all of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbb{F}\)</span>-irreducible factors in
the Smith form for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\lambda)\)</span>.</p>

<p><em>“Inverse Problems for Polynomial and Rational Matrices”</em></p>
<p>Inverse problems have long been studied in mathematics not only because there are
many applications in science and engineering, but also because they yield new insight into
the beauty of mathematics. Central to the subject of linear algebra is the eigenvalue problem:
given a matrix, and its eigenvalues (numerical invariants). Eigenvalue problems play a key
role in almost every field of scientific endeavor from calculating the vibrational modes of a
molecule to modeling the spread of an infectious disease, and so have been studied extensively
since the time of Euler in the 18th century.</p>
<p>If a typical matrix eigenvalue problem asks for the eigenvalues of a given matrix, an
inverse eigenvalue problem asks for a matrix whose eigenvalues are a given list of numbers.
For matrices over an algebraically closed field, the inverse eigenvalue problem is completely
and transparently solved by the Jordan canonical form. If the field is not algebraically closed,
there are similar, albeit more involved, solutions, a prime example of which is the real Jordan
form when the field is the real numbers.</p>
<p>Eigenvalue and inverse eigenvalue problems go beyond just matrices with fixed scalar
entries. They have been studied for matrix pencils, which are matrices whose entries are
degree-one polynomials with coeficients from a field. A polynomial matrix is a matrix whose
entries are polynomials with coficients from a field. The story of eigenvalues for polynomial
matrices (of which matrix pencils are a special case) is more complicated because of the
possibility of an infinite eigenvalue. In addition, for singular polynomial matrices, there
are invariants that characterize the left and right null spaces called minimal indices. The
collection of all this data (finite and infinite eigenvalues together with minimal indices) is
known as the structural data of the polynomial matrix.</p>
<p>In this dissertation, the inverse structural data problem for polynomial matrices is
considered and solved. We begin with the history of this inverse problem, including known
results and applications from the literature. Then a new solution is given that is sparse and
transparently reveals the structural data in much the same way that the Jordan canonical
form transparently reveals the structural data of a scalar matrix. The dissertation concludes
by discussing the inverse problem for rational matrices (matrices whose entries are rational
functions over a field) and presenting a solution adapted from the solution for the polynomial
matrix inverse problem.</p>

<p><em>“Van Dooren’s Index Sum Theorem and Rational Matrices with Prescribed Structural Data”</em></p>
<p>The structural data of any rational matrix <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R(\lambda)\)</span>, i.e., the structural indices of its poles and zeros
together with the minimal indices of its left and right nullspaces, is known to satisfy a simple condition
involving certain sums of these indices. This fundamental constraint was first proved by Van Dooren in
1978; here we refer to this result as the rational index sum theorem. An analogous result for polynomial
matrices has been independently discovered (and rediscovered) several times in the past three decades. In
this paper we clarify the connection between these two seemingly different index sum theorems, describe a
little bit of the history of their development, and discuss their curious apparent unawareness of each
other. Finally, we use the connection between these results to solve a fundamental inverse problem for
rational matrices–for which lists <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> of prescribed structural data does there exist some rational
matrix <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R(\lambda)\)</span> that realizes exactly the list <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span>? We show that Van Dooren’s condition is the only
constraint on rational realizability; that is, a list <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> is the structural data of some rational
matrix <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R(\lambda)\)</span> if and only if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> satisfies the rational index sum condition.</p>
