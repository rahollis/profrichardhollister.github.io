*Inverse problems for polynomial and rational matrices* `slides <../_static/ICIAM-2019-symposium-talk-RH.pdf>`_

This was an invited talk for the Nonlinear and Multiparamter Eigenvalue Problems mini-symposium at the 2019
International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics.  The talk outlines the procedures I developed
to construct a rational matrix realization for any given list of rational structural data in such a way that
the structural data can be recovered from the realization with minimal effort.

*Recent advances on an inverse problem for rational matrices* `slides <../_static/ICIAM-2019-contributed-talk-RH.pdf>`_

A contributed talk at 2019 International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics, this talk served as
an introduction to rational eigenvalue problems and discussed the inverse problem mentioned in my mini-
symposium talk described above.

*An Introduction to Nonlinear Eigenvalue Problems* `slides <../_static/Intro-nonlinear-eig-probs.pdf>`_

I gave this talk for a colloquium at Colorado Mesa University during an enjoyable visit to their campus.
The talk was meant to be a survey of eigenvalue problems leading up to the polynomial and rational 
eigenvalue problems that are the focus of my research.  Inverse problems were briefly mentioned.

*Exterior algebra and compound matrices* `slides <../_static/The-exterior-power-of-linear-maps.pdf>`_

In the Spring of 2018, while I was still a graduate student at Western Michigan University, I started a 
general math and math education seminar for graduate students called the Grad Math Talk Series.  This was the
inaugural talk featuring two constructs that most graduate students are not very familiar with, if at all.
The link between the exterior algebra and compound matrices is explicitly described and proved in the talk.

*Canonical matrices* `slides <../_static/Canonical-decompositions.pdf>`_

This talk was the first talk of the second semester of the Grad Math Talk Series, the seminar I started as a
graduate student.  This second talk I gave for the seminar was an exploration of what it means to be
canonical using the examples I am most familiar with from my own area of expertise.
