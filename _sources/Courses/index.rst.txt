*MTH 337 - Intro to Scientific and Mathematical Computing*  `website <https://rahollis.github.io>_`

This is a project based course that introduces
mathematics students to the tools and techniques used in scientific and mathematical computing.  The course
uses Python as a platform and focuses on about 8 independent projects over the semester.  Students are
encouraged to work in groups, but each student must turn in their own original project report as a Jupyter
notebook.

*MTH 420 - Advanced Linear Algebra* `syllabus <../_static/syllabus-420-s22.pdf>`_

This course is meant to be a second course in linear algbrea for undergraduates and focuses on theory 
proof.  Advanced topics include matrix factorizations, equivalence relations and canonical representations,
quadratic forms and positive (semi-) definite matrices, and select topics from numerical linear algebra.

*MTH 309 - Intro to Linear Algebra* `syllabus <../_static/syllabus-309-f21.pdf>`_

This is a your standard introductory course on linear algebra.  Topics ranged from systems of equations
and matrix algebra to vector spaces and linear transformations to orthogonal projections and least squares.

*MTH 122 - Survey of Calculus and Its Applications II* `syllabus <../_static/syllabus-122-f20.pdf>`_

The second semester in a two semester calculus sequence for life sciences and non-STEM majors.  The
focus of the course is on the applications of calculus to real world problems along with the computational
tools and techniques needed to solve those problems.  Topics included optimization and lagrange multipliers,
integration techniques and work problems, and numerical solutions to differential equations.
